# Getting Started

First clone the repository from Github and switch to the new directory:

    $ git@github.com:LemmyMwaura/Pivo-Test-Workspace.git
    
Install project dependencies:

    $ npm install     

Create your own Firebase Project, Register the app, then copy the Firebase web SDK:

    $ const firebaseConfig = {...}


Create environments folder and then an environment.ts file in the src folder of the first app in the apps folder and then paste the sdk as :

    $ firebase : {...}

You can now run the development server on any specific app:

    $ nx serve <app name>

* app name === directory name in the apps folder
